This is a full-stack application that let's users save topics and notes inside them. User can search for a topic and if the searched topic exists, server side uses Wikipedia opensearch API to fetch related wikipedia links to the topic name.
User can select which link he/she wants to save and the saved link will be saved to the database (which is just a data.json) file here.
